    <h2 id="1">1. Lunchbox Friends</h2>
    <p>“Lunchbox Friends” is the eighth track from Melanie Martinez’s sophomore album, K-12. In the track, Melanie details her adversity to fake friendships.</p>
    <p> K-12, Melanie’s sophomore album, was released alongside a movie of the same name. “Lunchbox Friends” plays while Crybaby (Melanie) is targeted by the plastics. She realizes that they don’t want a lasting relationship with her, and breaks away from their table. During this she meets her new friend, Magnolia</p>
    <p>A lunchbox friend is someone you only talk to at school and never hang out anywhere else.
They usually talk about gossip and people who they want to fuck and talk behind your back.<br>
They’re fake and probably only hang out with you for clout or just because you pose a threat towards them.<strong>
      “I don’t want no lunchbox friends no oh” ~ Melanie Martinez</strong></p>

      <h3> Lyrics</h3>
      <pre>No, oh, no, oh
No, oh, no, oh

You said, "Hey girl, will you sit with me?
Table in the back, Cafeteria C
We can be friends if you wanna be
But only 'til the clock hits three
After lunch we can walk to class
Talk about the boys that we want to smash
Talk about ways to get a little more cash
After that I'll ignore your ass"

The hassle, the fighting, they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos
Then gossip 'bout hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though

I don't want no lunchbox friends, no, oh
I want someone who understands, oh, oh
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no, oh
No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no, oh

No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever

They want a fat ass in the brand new jeans
Want a baby in the back with the man of their dreams
That isn't the life for me
I don't look like a fucking damn Barbie
Throw it on TV, people have high expectations of me
Wanna be my best friend then judge me
If I smoke a little weed
Makes no fucking sense to me

The hassle, the fighting, they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos
Then gossip about hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though

I don't want no lunchbox friends, no, oh
I want someone who understands, oh, oh
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no, oh
No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever, no, oh

No, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that will last forever
No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever, no
No, oh, no, oh, no, oh
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever

No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that will last forever</pre>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>Pinky promise
I'll still love your garden
Even with no flowers
Even with no flowers
Doctor's orders
Don't be brokenhearted
Time will still be ours
Time will still be ours

Never thought that something
Something so tragic
Could ever happen to
Our peaceful, little perfect family
I promise
Promise to love you
You and the children
Carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever
(You make moments last forever)

Eyes like hazel
Twinkle in the starlight
Even when they're crying
Even when they're crying
Constellations
Forming out of scar lines
Even when they're dying
Love will still be trying

Never thought that something
Something so tragic
Could ever happen to
Our peaceful, little perfect family
I promise
Promise to love you
You and the children
Carousel spinnin'
Our neighborhood will always be this pretty

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever

Bombs are falling on Monday morning
Bombs are falling, you make moments last forever

Bombs are falling
On Monday morning
Waiting for the news together
An explosion, any moment
You make moments last forever and ever

Bombs are falling on Monday morning
Bombs are falling
You make moments last forever
You make moments last forever</pre>

    <h2 id="3"> 3. Wheels on The Bus</h2>
   <p> “Wheels on the Bus” is the opening track to Melanie Martinez’s sophomore album, K-12.<br>
The track plays while Cry Baby, Martinez’s character in the K-12 film, is on a bus ride to “Sleepaway School.” Thematically, it dives into the way society turns a blind eye toward troubled teenagers, detailing Crybaby’s distaste with the tomfoolery happening on the bus; such as student’s having sexual relations, smoking weed, stripping their clothes, and the fact that it’s all being overlooked by the bus driver.<br>
There is also a dual meaning to some of the lyrics – they can be interpreted as having to do with the conflicts of society and how the people in power choose to deal with them.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>I'm just looking out the window and it's cold outside
There are two boys yelling behind me and I'm terrified
Counting trees as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look across the aisle
'Cause Maya's letting Dan put his hand up her skirt
And she's got her hand down his pants

I know the driver sees it
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror
He says nothing
Trying to ignore it is fucking boring
I'm quietly observing, I'm saying nothing

No one's watching us, don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus

Now, I'ma light it up and pass it
Puff, puff and pass it
Don't be a dick and babysit, "Come on, just pass it over here"
Counting cars as they pass me by
And I'm trying not to look a row behind me
'Cause Jason's got his ass on the glass
And I hate him, driver hit a bump fast

I know the driver sees it
I know he's peeking in the rearview mirror
He says nothing
Trying to ignore it, it's fucking boring
I'm quietly observing, I'm saying nothing

No one's watching us, don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus

Ooh, ooh, oh, ooh
Wheels on the, on the bus
Ooh, ha, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh
Wheels on the bus

No one's watching us, don't give a fuck
Wheels on the bus
I'm holding it down up in the front
Wheels on the bus
Ooh (Wheels on the bus)
Ooh (Wheels on the bus)
Ooh
Wheels on the bus</pre>

    <h2 id="4">4. Milk and Cookies</h2>
    <p>"Milk and Cookies" is the tenth track by Melanie Martinez featured on her debut album, Cry Baby. The first studio snippet was released on August 6th, 2015 on Melanie's Instagram. It is the sequel to Tag, You're It and a double feature music video for the song was released on August 23rd, 2016. </p>
    <p>Milk and Cookies is a continuation of the storyline from Tag, You're It after Cry Baby was kidnapped. In this song, Cry Baby is so distraught that something in her snaps and she kills her kidnapper with poisonous milk and cookies. She wears black to symbolize his impending death, since black is commonly worn at funerals, and sarcastically mentions how good she looks in it.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>1, 2,
Melatonin is coming for you
3, 4,
Baby, won't you lock the door?
5, 6,
I'm done with this
7, 8,
It's getting late,
So close your eyes, sleep for days

Hush, little baby,
Drink your spoiled milk
I'm fucking crazy,
Need my prescription filled

Do you like my cookies?
They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar,
But lots of poison, too

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

9, 10,
Never want to see you again
11, 12,
I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain
That I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone,
Think twice when you grab the phone

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

Ashes, ashes, time to go down
Ooh-ooh, honey, do you want me now?
Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end

    <h2 id="5">5. Tag You're It</h2>
    <p>"Tag, You're It", originally titled "Tag", is the ninth track by Melanie Martinez featured on her debut album, Cry Baby. The first studio snippet was released on August 3rd, 2015 on Melanie's Instagram. It is the prequel to Milk and Cookies and a double feature music video for the song was released on August 23rd, 2016.</p>
    <p>Tag, You're It is about Cry Baby getting kidnapped, utilizing the children's game "tag" as a metaphor. Cry Baby is now very vulnerable and alone, and gets kidnapped by a "wolf". As the song begins, it is evident that the "wolf" has been watching her for a while, and sees her as the perfect victim. The "wolf" pulls up alongside Cry Baby in his car and offers her candy. The tinted windows will hide her once she’s inside. Despite the fact that she says no, he continues to pursue her and chase her through the parking lot, meaning that she's running and he's following after her. The phrase, "Tag, you're it" is a metaphor for him catching her. He finally catches up to her, pushing her down so she stops running and covers her mouth so she cannot scream. She still screams for help but her situation is starting to seem hopeless. She attempts to fight back by biting him, despite being incapacitated in the lyric, "Little bit of poison in me, I can taste your skin in my teeth". She is taken to his basement where he is fascinated by the proof of her presence through something as simple as her breathing.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
"I'll cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner"

Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
"Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside"

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hair, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden underground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, "Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
He's saying, "Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"

Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
"I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving"

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden underground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, "Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"
He's saying, "Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it"

Eenie meenie miny mo
Catch a lady by her toes
If she squeals, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am

Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Take the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it</pre>

    <h2 id="6">6. Pacify Her</h2>
    <p>"Pacify Her" is the eleventh track by Melanie Martinez featured on her debut album, Cry Baby. It is one of the few songs to have two studio snippets released in summer/fall of 2014. Melanie released a snippet for this song on August 7th, 2015 on her Instagram. The music video was released on November 15th, 2016.</p>
    <p>Cry Baby no longer cares whether she's with a guy, but she gets rid of the girl (Basic Bitch) he was with just for fun. Cry Baby is set on trying to free a boy from the grip of a girlfriend, even though she doesn’t really love the boy herself. She uses a play on words in the title – it can be heard as “pacifier”, which is a rubber object used to silence a crying infant. She knows that the boy has feelings for her and not for his current lover, so she insists that he should get rid of her once and for all: she’s embraced being a homewrecker. This may be Cry Baby taking after her father, whom she has experienced witnessing his many affairs behind her drunken mother's back before his death.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girl's hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man

Someone told me, "Stay away from things that aren't yours"
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words, word, word

I can't stand her whining
Where's her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down

Someone told me, "Stay away from things that aren't yours"
But was he yours, if he wanted me so bad?

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words, word, word

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words

Pacify her
She's getting on my nerves
You don't love her
Stop lying with those words, word, word</pre>

    <h2 id="7">7. Play Date</h2>
    <p>"Play Date", sometimes stylized as "Playdate", is the fourteenth track by Melanie Martinez featured on the deluxe version of her debut album, Cry Baby. It is the first deluxe track on the album, the second being Teddy Bear and the third being Cake. On June 26th, 2020, the song was included as the B-side to Fire Drill on Spotify.</p>
    <p>This tells the story of Cry Baby feeling like she’s nothing more than a friend to someone who seems to care very little about her, even though they get together often. Frustrated, she outwardly proclaims she is just as uncommitted as he is, and how she's tired of all the games she has to play to stay with him. She wishes she didn’t care about how little he communicates or how much she has to chase after him, but she can't stop thinking about him. The entirety of the song is one contradiction after the next. While swearing she couldn't care less about him, in the final moments of the song she admits she does care about him and does value their "play date".</p>
<h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you wanna play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I wanna give you, wanna give you
What you need

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you</pre>

    <h2 id="8">8. Teddy Bear</h2>
    <p>"Teddy Bear" is the fifteenth song by Melanie Martinez, featured on the deluxe version of Cry Baby. It is the second featured track on the deluxe version of the album, the first being Play Date and the third being Cake.</p>
    <p>Cry Baby's lover, or "teddy bear", whom she built a relationship with nothing but kindness and love, is beginning to act strangely. She begins to lose hope in her bear, and she’s unsure if she should trust him anymore. As the song goes on, the more dangerous and insane their relationship becomes. It takes a turn for the worse after her lover attempts to "kill her". She doesn't understand where everything went wrong and why her bear suddenly wants to kill her. The song and the teddy bear is metaphorically interpreted as a relationship that took a turn for the worse.</p>
    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh, what could I do?

When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
I wasn't scared
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Should I be scared?

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

La, la, la, la, la

I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
But now you're back
It's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you're showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
I'm fucking scared

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

[Backwards:]
I didn't outgrow you

I'm fucking scared

Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

La, la, la, la, la</pre>

    <h2 id="9">9. Mrs. Potato Head</h2>
    <p>"Mrs. Potato Head" is the 12th track from Melanie Martinez's debut studio album, Cry Baby. She first confirmed this song would be on the album on June 1st, 2015, and mentioned that it was the most fun to write. On August 10th, 2015, Melanie posted a snippet of the song on her Instagram.

The chorus of the song was leaked on August 3rd after a fan recorded it at one of her intimate V.I.P. shows, despite the fact that fans were not allowed to record or use their handheld devices that night of the show.

The music video was released on December 1st, 2016.</p>
    <p>The video begins with Cry Baby watching television in her house while brushing her doll's hair and eating cookies. She sees an advertisement for diet pills and begins to believe she needs to be skinnier and stops eating her cookies. An advertisement for blonde wigs comes up, which make a tearful Cry Baby go to the bathroom. She stuffs tissues in her bra to make it look like she has larger breasts, referencing the events in Pacify Her. She then puts on red lipstick, a blonde wig, and swallows a diet pill. Cry Baby walks back to the living room and changes the channel, showing Mrs. Potato Head greeting her husband. He gives her flowers, a necklace, and a note that says she has a facelift scheduled. She tries to act happy, but, in reality, she is very nervous. On the day of the appointment, Mr. Potato Head shows the doctors what he would like done to his wife by drawing surgical lines on her face. Then, the surgery is shown. The Bunny Doctor attempts to give Mrs. Potato Head larger breasts and a facelift but is shown numerous times cutting completely cutting out of the surgical lines and stuffing the inside of her breasts with tissues. After being discharged and sent home, Mr. Potato Head cuts Mrs. Potato Head's hair shorter while she is asleep, much to her horror when she looks at herself the mirror later on, Mr. Potato Head runs in and comforts his wife, and then he takes her bandages off. To his surprise, the surgery went horribly wrong and Mrs. Potato Head's face is now ruined and he instructs her to wear a blonde wig and wear make up to hopefully cover up the damage. But, because she is now ugly in his eyes, Mr. Potato Head leaves his wife for another woman, and a devastated Mrs. Potato Head who had secretly watching this happening outside from an upstairs window, breaks down in tears and the film ends. Affected by the show, Cry Baby takes off the wig and removes the tissues from her bra. She realizes that she is perfect the way she is and that she doesn't need to change for anyone else.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
        <pre>If you weren't born with it
            You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
'Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it, ha-ha
Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable

Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
Even if her face don't stay together

If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mother's face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate

Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic, it's only some plastic
No one will love you if you're unattractive

Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together

Oh, Mrs. Potato Head, tell me, is it true that pain is beauty?
Does a new face come with a warranty?
Will a pretty face make it better?
Oh, Mr. Potato Head, tell me
How did you afford her surgery?
Do you swear you'll stay forever?

Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together</pre>

    <h2 id="10">10. Recess</h2>
    <p>"Recess" is the thirteenth and final track by Melanie Martinez that is featured on the standard edition of her sophomore album, K-12. The music video, originally available as part of the film, was separately released on February 7th, 2020.</p>
    <p>The song is about letting go of harmful and toxic people, as well as how it is important to maintain your mental health when times are rough. The pre-chorus could be touching on the music industry, as artists are often overworked and receive little breaks, while the second they take some time for themselves they are replaced by another artist. The song is also likely very personal to Melanie, as she mentions her grandmother, Lydia, several times, quoting advice that she had given Melanie when she was young.</p>

    <h3> Lyrics</h3>
<pre>I was too young to see the truth
In my grandma's lap, I'm drowning in her perfume
Too naive to even care
'Bout the words she whispered while she brushed out my hair

People gonna say
"If you need a break, someone will take your place"
People gonna try
To tell you that "you're fine" with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try
Ooh, don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, "Recess, I'm tired"

Sittin' in my room, looking at all I've done
Everything I wanted has come to fruition
I should be happy but I can't get out my bed
Stressin' 'bout the voices screamin' inside my head

People gonna say
"If you need a break, someone will take your place"
People gonna try
To tell you that "you're fine" with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try
Ooh, don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, "Recess, I'm tired"

Where is my time?
Gone in my mind
Gone, I can't find
Euphoria
When I get upset
I think in my head
Back to what she said

People gonna say
"If you need a break, someone will take your place"
People gonna try
To tell you that "you're fine" with dollars in their eyes
(Just remember)

Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try
Ooh, don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, "Recess, I'm tired"</pre>
